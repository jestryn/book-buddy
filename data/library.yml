  :description: 'The #1 New York Times bestseller Sent to the most violent battlefield
    in Iraq, Jocko Willink and Leif Babin’s SEAL task unit faced a seemingly impossible
    mission: help U.S. forces secure Ramadi, a city deemed “all but lost.” In gripping
    firsthand accounts of heroism, tragic loss, and hard-won victories in SEAL Team
    Three’s Task Unit Bruiser, they learned that leadership—at every level—is the
    most important factor in whether a team succeeds or fails.Willink and Babin returned
    home from deployment and instituted SEAL leadership training that helped forge
    the next generation of SEAL leaders. After departing the SEAL Teams, they launched
    Echelon Front, a company that teaches these same leadership principles to businesses
    and organizations. From promising startups to Fortune 500 companies, Babin and
    Willink have helped scores of clients across a broad range of industries build
    their own high-performance teams and dominate their battlefields. Now, detailing
    the mind-set and principles that enable SEAL units to accomplish the most difficult
    missions in combat, Extreme Ownership shows how to apply them to any team, family
    or organization. Each chapter focuses on a specific topic such as Cover and Move,
    Decentralized Command, and Leading Up the Chain, explaining what they are, why
    they are important, and how to implement them in any leadership environment. A
    compelling narrative with powerful instruction and direct application, Extreme
    Ownership revolutionizes business management and challenges leaders everywhere
    to fulfill their ultimate purpose: lead and win.'

  :description: 'A WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER by DR. JOE DISPENZA , the author
    of the New York Times bestseller You Are the Placebo , as well as Breaking the
    Habit of Being Yourself and Evolve Your Brain. Becoming Supernatural draws on
    epigenetics, quantum physics & neuroscience research conducted at his advanced
    workshops since 2012 to explore how common people are doing the uncommon to transform
    their consciousness, mindset, and beliefs to heal and live SUPERNATURAL lives.
      “ From a gifted scientist and passionate teacher, this unique and practical
    guide shows us—step by step—how to move beyond the limits of the known and into
    an extraordinary new life.” — Tony Robbins, #1 New York Times best-selling author
    of Unshakeable   Becoming Supernatural marries some of the most profound scientific
    information with ancient spiritual wisdom to show how people like you and me can
    experience a more mystical life.   Readers will learn that we are, quite literally
    supernatural by nature if given the proper knowledge and instruction, and when
    we learn how to apply that information through various healing meditations , we
    should experience a greater expression of our creative abilities.   We have the
    capacity to tune in to frequencies beyond our material world and receive more
    orderly coherent streams of consciousness and energy; that we can intentionally
    change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical transcendental experiences
    ; and how, if we do this enough times, we can develop the skill of creating a
    more efficient, balanced, healthy body, a more unlimited mind, and greater access
    to the quantum field and the realms of spiritual truth. Topics include: • Demystifying
    the body’s 7 energy centers and how you can balance them to heal • How to free
    yourself from the past by reconditioning your body to a new mind • How you can
    create reality in the generous present moment by changing your energy • The difference
    between third-dimension creation and fifth-dimension creation • The secret science
    of the pineal gland and its role in accessing mystical realms of reality • The
    distinction between Space-Time vs. Time-Space realities • And much more   Chapters
    include: · Opening the Door to the Supernatural · The Present Moment · Tuning
    In to New Potentials in the Quantum · Blessing of the Energy Centers · Reconditioning
    the Body to a New Mind · Case Studies: Living Examples of Truth · Heart Intelligence
    · Mind Movies/Kaleidoscope · Walking Meditation · Case Studies: Making It Real
    · Space-Time and Time-Space · The Pineal Gland · Project Coherence: Making a Better
    World · Case Studies: It Could Happen to You Using tools and disciplines ranging
    from cutting-edge physics to practical exercises such as a walking meditation,
    Dr. Joe offers nothing less than a proven program for stepping outside our physical
    reality and into the quantum field of infinite possibilities.   “ Dr. Joe Dispenza
    is a doctor, a scientist, and a modern-day mystic. . . . In a style that is simple,
    straightforward, and easy to understand, [he] has woven into a single volume the
    paradigm-altering discoveries of quantum science and the deep teachings that adepts
    of the past dedicated their entire lifetimes to master.” — from the foreword by
    Gregg Braden, New York Times best-selling author of Human by Design and The Divine
    Matrix   “I wrote this book to take what I’ve always thought was possible to the
    next level of understanding. I wanted to demonstrate to the world that we can
    create better lives for ourselves—and that we are not linear beings living linear
    lives, but dimensional beings living dimensional lives. Hopefully, reading it
    will help you understand that you already have all the anatomy, chemistry, and
    physiology you need to become supernatural sitting latent within you, waiting
    to be awakened and activated.” - Dr. Joe Dispenza   New York Times best-selling
    author Researcher of epigenetics, quantum physics & neuroscience'

  :description: 'In this expanded edition of the 2017 mega-bestseller, updated with
    brand new sections like DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY, SUGAR COATED LIES and DON''T
    NEGOTIATE WITH WEAKNESS, readers will discover new ways to become stronger, smarter,
    and healthier. Jocko Willink''s methods for success were born in the SEAL Teams,
    where he spent most of his adult life, enlisting after high school and rising
    through the ranks to become the commander of the most highly decorated special
    operations unit of the war in Iraq. In Discipline Equals Freedom , the #1 New
    York Times bestselling coauthor of Extreme Ownership describes how he lives that
    mantra: the mental and physical disciplines he imposes on himself in order to
    achieve freedom in all aspects of life. Many books offer advice on how to overcome
    obstacles and reach your goals--but that advice often misses the most critical
    ingredient: discipline. Without discipline, there will be no real progress. Discipline
    Equals Freedom covers it all, including strategies and tactics for conquering
    weakness, procrastination, and fear, and specific physical training presented
    in workouts for beginner, intermediate, and advanced athletes, and even the best
    sleep habits and food intake recommended to optimize performance. FIND YOUR WILL,
    FIND YOUR DISCIPLINE--AND YOU WILL FIND YOUR FREEDOM'

  :description: "#1 New York Times Bestseller Oprah's Book Club Selection The “extraordinary
    . . . monumental masterpiece” ( Booklist ) that changed the course of Ken Follett’s
    already phenomenal career—and begins where its prequel,  The Evening and the Morning
    , ended. “Follett risks all and comes out a clear winner,” extolled  Publishers
    Weekly  on the release of  The Pillars of the Earth . A departure for the bestselling
    thriller writer, the historical epic stunned readers and critics alike with its
    ambitious scope and gripping humanity. Today, it stands as a testament to Follett’s
    unassailable command of the written word and to his universal appeal.    The Pillars
    of the Earth  tells the story of Philip, prior of Kingsbridge, a devout and resourceful
    monk driven to build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has known . . . of
    Tom, the mason who becomes his architect—a man divided in his soul . . . of the
    beautiful, elusive Lady Aliena, haunted by a secret shame . . . and of a struggle
    between good and evil that will turn church against state and brother against
    brother.   A spellbinding epic tale of ambition, anarchy, and absolute power set
    against the sprawling medieval canvas of twelfth-century England, this is Ken
    Follett’s historical masterpiece."

    alien race. Long before the rise of the native civilizations, they had terrorized
    a hundred worlds--not from villainy but from folly. Now the task was to destroy
    their potency for mischief. This is the story of one such Gate.
